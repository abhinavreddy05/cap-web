You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our Affiliates, and our and our Affiliates’ respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers and contractors (collectively, “Indemnified Parties”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with, the Portal, Services or Margin Tokens; (b) Ethereum Blockchain assets associated with your Ethereum Address; (c) any feedback or user content you provide to the Portal, if any; (d) your violation of these Terms; or (e) your infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If you are obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party, Idle (or, at its discretion, the applicable Indemnified Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Idle wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms.

<h4 class=title-h4>9. Disclosures, Disclaimers</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
Idle is a developer of open-source software. Idle does not operate a digital asset exchange platform or execute peer-to-peer transactions through its Protocol and therefore has no oversight, involvement, or control with respect to your transactions, which are executed through third-party protocols and the Ethereum Blockchain. The Protocol is an autonomous decentralized web protocol deployed to the Ethereum Blockchain that operates in a disintermediated fashion, and, as such, Idle does not participate in any of these transactions. In each instance, when you interact with the Protocol, you are interacting with a smart contract that transfers your digital assets to a third-party protocol.
<br><br>
[Under U.S. federal law, unless you are an “eligible contract participant” as defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18), your transaction must settle within 28 days. Individuals who do not have more than $10 million invested on a discretionary basis (or $5 million if the transaction is for the purpose of managing risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred) are not eligible contract participants and may not enter into transactions using the Idle open-source software that do not result in actual delivery of digital assets within 28 days.]
<br><br>
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your transactions, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
<br><br>
You understand that Idle is not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or any financial regulatory authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Idle open-source software. This website and the Idle open-source software do not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security or other asset. Idle is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person.
<br><br>
Idle does not own or control the underlying software protocols that enable the Protocol to function. In general, the underlying protocols are open-source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. Idle is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols, and Idle makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.
<br><br>
To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Portal and the Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Portal or the Services (including any data relating thereto) will be uninterrupted, available at any particular time or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Portal or the Service are correctable or will be correctable.
<br><br>
You acknowledge that your data on the Portal may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or other technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your computer equipment), protocol changes by third party providers, Internet outages, force majeure events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside our control.
<br><br>
The disclaimer of implied warranties contained herein may not apply if and to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the Applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside.

<section id=consequential-related-damages>
<h4 class=title-h4>10. Exclusion of consequential and related Damages</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
In no event shall we (together with our Affiliates, including our and our Affiliates’ respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers or contractors) be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Portal and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Ether, Margin Tokens or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of us, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not we have been advised of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy hereunder nor is Idle in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of Idle open-source software.
</p>
</section>
<section id=limitation-liability>
<h4 class=title-h4>11. Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
In no event shall our aggregate liability (together with our Affiliates, including our and our Affiliates’ respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers or contractors) arising out of or in connection with the Portal and the Services (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Ether, Margin Tokens or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of us, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability or other theory of liability exceed the amount of fees paid by you to us under these Terms, if any, in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.
</p>
</section>
<section id=dispute-resolution>
<h4 class=title-h4>12. Dispute, Resolution and Arbitration</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Idle and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. You and Idle agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Idle and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
<br><br>
Except for small claims disputes in which you or Idle seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Idle seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Idle waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Idle or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Idle and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Idle by email at info@idle.finance or by certified mail addressed to info@idle.finance. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Idle cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in New York City, New York, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
<br><br>
You and Idle agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
<br><br>
The arbitrator, Idle, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
<br><br>
You and Idle agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Idle will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Idle, Idle will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Idle agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York City, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
<br><br>
Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Idle will not have the right to assert the claim.
<br><br>
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 12 by emailing us at info@idle.finance. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 13.
<br><br>
If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 12; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 12 will be enforceable.
</p>
</section>
<section id=governing-law>
<h4 class=title-h4>13. Governing Law</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Portal or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.
</p>
</section>
<section id=miscellaneous>
<h4 class=title-h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p class=desc-3>
Any right or remedy of Idle set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Portal or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Portal or the Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Portal and the Services. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement supersedes these Terms.
